### Reasons to found a startup

* Avoid entering the work force after graduation
* Money (9/10 startups fail, 1/100 unicorn)
* See your idea get big
* **Self actualization**

Note: self-actualization is a powerfull driver
if money or no real drive, my advice is wrong
if money is your motivation, then you can do a lot more bullshit

### Exploration vs Stabilization

* Startups are fragile -> reduce risk
* Risk = uncertainty
* So: Build stuff, throw it at the user, learn, reduce uncertainty
* But: Only prototyping creates its own risk: Technological debt
* Worst case: complete stand-still

Note: Engineers are susceptible to overengineering

Note: mention simplification, environment may change, pivot

### Adjust your pace often

* Be sensible to inefficiencies
* Too rigid -> loosen structures
* Too chaotic -> find the most central element, nail it down
* Don't overshoot

### Prototype or Product?

* Get clear on expectations!
* Either you prototype or you build components of your product
  <br> → Prototype: Take all the shortcuts you can to achieve your learning
  <br> → Product: Do it proper the first time. It only gets worse.
* Don't let your prototype become your product
* Be rigorous

### Radical minimalism
* Single sources of truth
* Tools: integration is key
* Keep it simple as long as possible (KISS & YAGNI)
* Plain text is king
* Ulysses pact: tie yourself to the mast

### Throwawayability

* Prototypes should be discardable with no cost
* Throwing away product components should be easy
* Also (and especially) applies to infrastructure

Note: generally good design advice. forces clean interfaces, thinking ahead

---

### Unsorted advice

* Use git
* Trust your team
* Your idea is not as valuable as you think
* You will need senior people
* Work on your social skills
* Use a personal task management system (e.g. GTD)
* Focus is crucial
* Burnout is real
