# Preview

What is the dilemma?<br>
Why exploration vs stabilization?

Note: exploration is required to know what we can build and what users want
stabilization is required for a product
its a problem prominent with developers
i cant give an easy solution myself

### Outline

> "Stuff that no one told me"

* 🚀 Motivations to found a startup
* 💀 Why startups fail
* 💡 **Exploration vs Stabilization**
* 🗃 Random advice

Note: Talk is about inner workings of organization, long-term
explain exploration and stabilization

### Reasons to found a startup

* Avoid entering the work force after graduation
* Money (9/10 startups fail, 1/100 unicorn)
* See your idea get big
* **Self actualization**

Note: self-actualization is a powerfull driver
if money or no real drive, my advice is wrong
if money is your motivation, then you can do a lot more bullshit

Note: numbers are not reliable, more of a hint
org dev is not on the chart, but affects PMF, team and tech

### Exploration vs Stabilization

* Startups are fragile<br>
→ You need to reduce risk<br>
→ Risk is equivalent to uncertainty<br>
→ Build stuff, throw it at the user, learn, reduce uncertainty
* But: Only prototyping creates its own risk<br>
→ No common basis, technological debt<br>
→ Worst case: complete stand-still

Note: explain again exploration, stabilization

### Adjust when necessary

* Be sensible to inefficiencies
* Too rigid → loosen structures<br>
  > <small>"Ditch custom PCB iterations, back to Arduino"</small><br>
  <small>"Are scalable and reproducible Kubernetes deployments really required already?"</small>
* Too chaotic → find the most central element, nail it down<br>
  > <small>"Let's not have 5 custom logging mechanisms"</small>
* Try not to overshoot, make small adjustments


----

### Prototype or Product?

* Get clear on expectations!
* Either you prototype or you build components of your product
  <br> → Prototype: Take all the shortcuts you can to achieve your learning
  <br> → Product: Do it proper the first time. It only gets worse.
* Don't let your prototype become your product
* Be rigorous


----

### Radical Minimalism
* Single sources of truth
* Maximize integration among tools
* Keep it simple as long as possible (KISS & YAGNI)
* Plain text wherever you can
* Ulysses pact: tie yourself to the mast

<!-- improve formatting -->

----

### Throwawayability

* Prototypes should be discardable with no cost
* Throwing away product components should be quite easy
* Also (and especially) applies to infrastructure

Note: metric i set up at Kiteswarms
goes a bit against stabilization
generally good design advice. forces clean interfaces, thinking ahead

### Unsorted advice

* ~~💡~~ Your idea is not as valuable as you think
* 🫂 Trust your team
* 👴 You will need senior people
* ❤️ Work on your social skills
* 📋 Use a personal task management system
* 🎯 Focus is crucial
* 💥 Burnout is real
