### Reasons to start a startup

* money

* Top prio: reduce uncertainty
* Build stuff, throw it at the user, learn
* But: only bastel creates its own risk. Worst case: complete stand still

### Be clear

* Either prototype or build platform
* Prototype: take all the shortcuts you can to achieve your learning
* Platform: Do it right the first time. There is no later.

### Throwawayability

Prototypes should be throwawayable with no cost
Throwing away platform modules should be easy
