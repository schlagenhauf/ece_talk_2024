### Exploration vs Stabilization

* Startups are fragile -> reduce risk
* Risk <=> uncertainty
* Build stuff, throw it at the user, learn, reduce uncertainty
* But: Only bastel creates its own risk, worst case: complete stand still
* Technological debt

----

### Plot: pace

----

### Be clear - prototype or platform?

* Either prototype or build platform
* Prototype: Take all the shortcuts you can to achieve your learning
* Platform: Do it proper the first time. It only gets worse.
* Be rigorous

----

### About pace

* Find the right pace
* Be sensible to inefficiencies
* Too rigid -> loosen structures
* Too chaotic -> find the most central element, nail it down

----

### Radical minimalism
* Single sources of truth
* Tools: integration is key
* Keep it simple as long as possible
* Plain text is king
* Ulysses pact: tie yourself to the mast

----

### Throwawayability

Prototypes should be throwawayable with no cost
Throwing away platform modules should be easy
Also applies to infrastructure

---

### Random advice

* Trust your team
* You will need senior people
* Work on your social skills
* Implement a personal task system (e.g. GTD)
* Focus is crucial
* Burnout is real
